        <div id="img-caption">This portrait of Ada Lovelace, painted in the mid-1800s, captures the elegance and intellect of the woman widely considered the worldâ€™s first computer programmer.  Born in 1815, Ada was a visionary mathematician who saw the potential of computing machines long before they were built. Her collaboration with Charles Babbage and her notes on the Analytical Engine laid the foundation for modern programming. In this image, her poised expression reflects her brilliance and forward-thinking mind, which continues to inspire generations of scientists and technologists.</div><br>
